In this assignment, I created a CRA app for posting markdown content, with CRUD functionality. The workers script is written in typescript, and authentication is done through the rust worker I wrote for the systems assignment. I added logic to handle reactions but did not implement it in the frontend yet. The app is deployed to https://postit.monster, with the api at https://api.postit.monster. The styling with created with chakra ui.
