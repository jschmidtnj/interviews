# census bureau

- differential privacy - adding noise to statistical queries
  - cannot reverse engineer queries - from 2006
  - privacy mechanism for 2021 census - February 2021 (no matter what degree of done)
  - post processing
- python and gurobi
  - 25-50 nodes
  - 8000 times run, each run has measurements of processes
  - 60 seconds to 60 hours
- dashboard to collect machine statistics
  - apache spark
  - application engineering work
    - change engineering
  - pyspark application
  - scala calls python
    - jvm to python bridge
    - maybe use different java garbage collector to see if that impacts performance
    - monitoring points
    - rds store on aws, mysql, not hitting limits at all
- state of the art
  - all differential privacy is custom-built
  - 200,000 - 1 million runs of optimizer
  - rdd's - 1 per each optimization
  - dask vs. spark wasn't mature enough when we started
  - data movement
- gurobi - optimizes stuff
  - up to 2000 simultaneous solves
  - has tracking code for license utilization
